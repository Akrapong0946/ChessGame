# Rubric for grading

Grading will be carried out **on the core requirements only**. Bonus additions, if implemented, should not break the game code or affect its core functionality. Each bonus addition, if successfully implemented, gains the group one bonus mark.

Teams may propose bonus additions

A score between 0-3 is given for each category. There are 5 categories in total:

- **Abstraction**  
  Assess how well the game is subdivided into methods and parts that are easy to understand.

- **Encapsulation**  
  Assesses whether data and methods are grouped appropriately, in ways that improve understanding of the code.

- **Clarity of code**  
  Assesses good programming practices in naming of variables and methods, and in writing code that is easy to understand.

- **User-friendliness**  
  Assesses whether the game provides useful information to players, whether for debugging or playing.

- **Functionality**  
  Assesses whether the game actually works.

**Max score:** 15

## Scoring system

### Abstraction

0: Methods rely heavily on underlying implementation
1: Methods occasionally rely on underlying implementation
2: Methods have little reliance on underlying implementation, but could be better abstracted
3: Methods do not rely on underlying implementation and are appropriately abstracted

### Encapsulation
0: Non-existent encapsulation
1: Game relies unnecessarily on variables and functions which are not part of the game or piece objects
2: Required variables and functions are encapsulated within the appropriate objects
3: Required variables and functions are encapsulated and appropriately defined (prudent use of `@staticmethod` and/or `@classmethod`)

### Clarity of code
0: Attributes and methods have obtuse names; code is not possible to understand
1: Poor naming of attributes and methods; code is difficult to understand
2: Attributes and methods are appropriately named, and code is written with intuitive logic. Unnecessary commented code left behind.
3: Attributes and methods are appropriately named, methods have helpful docstrings, code is intuitive and easy to read.

### User-friendliness
0: No useful output for debugging
1: Hard to tell what is wrong when testing the game; unhelpful console messages
2: Console messages indicate a problem and aid debugging somewhat
3: Console output is helpful for debugging and point to a clear, helpful cause

### Functionality
0: Game does not run
1: Game is not able to run 2 turns
2: Game mostly works, but is unable to execute a chess game as expected
3: Game passes mosts tests, and failing tests does not affect core functionality
